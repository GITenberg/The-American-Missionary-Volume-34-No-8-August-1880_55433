<h3>ANNUAL MEETING.</h3>

<p class="p1">The next Annual Meeting of the <span class="smcap">American Missionary Association</span> will be
held in Norwich, Ct., in the Broadway Church, commencing Tuesday, October 12,
at 3 <span class="medium">P. M.</span></p>

<p>Rev. Wm. M. Taylor, D.D., of New York City, will preach the Sermon.
Other addresses and papers will be announced hereafter.</p>

<p>The time is fixed to meet the convenience of those who wish to attend our
meeting as well as those of the American Board, the State Conference, and the
National Council.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>FINANCIAL NOTICE.</h3>

<p class="p1">Only two months remain of our fiscal year. We regret to say that a debt of
nearly $20,000 is impending. This arises from the encouragement which the
prosperity of the country at the beginning of our fiscal year gave us to make some
additional appropriations to meet the most urgent calls that pressed upon us from
the field. A decline in that prosperity has been intensified by the drought in
many parts of the country, and our receipts for our regular work have fallen off.</p>

<p>We give the notice thus early that pastors and churches who sympathize with
us and in our work, and in our effort to avoid a debt, may take immediate steps
to avert the danger. We are confident that if the collections of churches that
are behind in their offerings, and those that are set down for August and September,
are promptly and generously made, the deficiency will be covered; but, fearing
this may not in all cases be done, we venture to ask individuals having our
cause at heart to assure the certainty by additional contributions.</p>

<p>The pastors and officers of the churches can be our most efficient helpers by
securing collections and making remittances promptly. We earnestly invoke the
aid of our friends. A debt at the close of this year (September 30) will compel
harmful retrenchment for the next. The field has never been more fruitful in good
results. The command of the Master is, “Go forward.” We cannot go into the

<h3>PARAGRAPHS.</h3>

<p class="p1"><i>Mrs. Sarah Spees</i>, who died at York, Nebraska, June 10th, was for many years
one of our faithful workers among the Indians at Red Lake, Minn. Born in 1832,
at Nelson, Ohio, she was converted at the age of fourteen years, and took at once
strong and decided grounds for Christ. She was for a time a pupil of Mr. Sturgis,
of Micronesia, who inspired her with missionary zeal. Soon after her marriage to
the Rev. Francis Spees, she went with him to his missionary field among the
Chippewas of Minnesota, bearing the severest privations. The journey required
great fortitude. The Indians were in the rudest state of heathenism, and life
itself was not secure. Amid scenes of danger and peril, she never shrank or
wavered, or regretted that she had entered on so arduous a work. For three
years, Mr. and Mrs. Spees labored among these people, and then left them for a
quieter work at Tabor, Iowa. Ten years later, the way was opened for their
return, and no sooner were they back among the red faces than a precious revival
was enjoyed among the Government employees. In addition to her work as missionary,
Mrs. Spees added the care of the Girl’s Boarding School. This was too
great a tax upon her, and after a few years her strength gave out, and she was
obliged to rest. For three years she waited by the river. Her pastor says that
often, when visiting her in her feebleness, he found her wearied with the slow
progress of the work of Christ on earth, and turning over in her mind how money
could be raised for the spread of the Gospel. Her work well done, she has now
entered upon the “rest that remaineth to the people of God.”</p>

<p><i>The Pastor of the Central Congregational Church</i> of Brooklyn must take a great
deal of solid satisfaction in the noble missionary work of its Sunday-school. Thoroughly
imbued as he is with the mission spirit, he does not fail to impart something
of it even to the lambs of his flock. This school is also blessed with one
of the most earnest and successful Christian workers of the city as its superintendent,
and, therefore, it is not surprising that, in addition to its own local
missionary work, it supports, this year, <em>four</em> missionaries—one in the foreign field,
and three among the Freedmen. We take great pleasure in referring to this
school, whose example might be followed by many others with great benefit to the
cause of missions, and, also, to the schools themselves.</p>

<p><i>A Burst of Patriotism.</i>—On the Confederate Decoration Day, at Montgomery,
Alabama, this year, the Memorial Address was delivered by Tennent Lomax, Esq.,
son of Gen. Lomax, who fell at the battle of Seven Pines, and whose monument,
the principal one in the cemetery at the capital, received the special floral attentions
of the day. We give an extract from the oration as printed in the local
daily:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Let us again to-day, standing upon this sacred spot, extend the hand of perfect
reconciliation to our fellow citizens of the North, and ask them to clasp that
hand in the true spirit of fraternal love, and to live with us as a band of brothers,
united in one grand enterprise, the advancement of the honor, the interest, and
the glory, of our common country; and to pray with us to almighty God to hasten

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a>

the advent of that day, for it must surely come, when the star-spangled banner,
‘with not a stripe erased or polluted, nor a single star obscured,’ shall float, not
over ‘a country dissevered, discordant, belligerent,’ but over a union of co-equal
States, re-united and bound together by a golden chain of unbroken friendship.”</p>

<p><i>At the meeting</i> of the North Carolina Conference at Dudley, in May, one of the
delegates, Deacon Stevens, of Beaufort, as he was preparing his pipe, heard the
little children of his host remarking to themselves about the poison of tobacco,
and the bad practice of using it. His thought was started. He went out to get
away by himself for a smoke. He observed that the people about him were not
indulging in that habit. At the end of the three days’ meeting, he searched about
the audience room to see if there were any of the defilements of tobacco. He
found none. That church, (Rev. D. Peebles, pastor,) and its Band of Hope eschew
tobacco as well as all intoxicating drinks. The deacon went home convinced,
as he said, that it was a “dirty, ugly, mean habit.” He joined in starting a
Band of Hope, and told his experience as above narrated. “A little child shall
lead them.” The little ones did not address him, but he thought that they intended
their remarks for his benefit.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Spurgeon</i> finds caste even in England. He says: “I know several half-sovereign
people who would not think of asking a half-a-crown to tea, and there
is a very strong aversion on the part of the half-crowns to the three-penny pieces;
and, perhaps, a stronger aversion still on the part of the three-pennies to anything
coppery. I have heard of a Christian minister in this country now, who, I am
told, is humble and useful and talented, but there is not a congregation that will
have him for its minister. He was nearly starved to death a few years ago, and
the great sin he has committed is that he married a black wife. Now, you would
not like a minister’s black wife; you know you would not. Up comes the caste
feeling directly. We condemn it in the Hindoo, and here it comes in this country.
We like a negro if he has been a slave, and we raise money for him when we
would not for a white man. Now, I do not think a black man is any better than
a white man, and I do not think that because a man is green he is at all superior.
I believe that we are all pretty nearly equal, and that God made of one blood all
nations on the face of the earth. But we want to hear these stories about caste in
India that we may be taught to avoid it here; and if it were not for these follies,
vanities, and prides of human nature, carried out to extremity abroad, we might
not so readily see them to be evils in what is thought to be a mild form at home”.</p>

<h3>TWO CONVENTIONS.</h3>

<p class="p1">During the sitting of the Virginia Republican Convention at Staunton, the
members were as free from molestation as they would have been at Worcester,
Mass., and the hotels were open for their entertainment, white and black alike.
For three days, colored men took their meals in common with white men and
women in the public dining-rooms of houses kept by life-long democrats. One
day, at the principal hotel, a black man was seen dining with representatives of
some of the oldest families of the State; other colored men sat at different tables
around the room; while a large number of staunch democrats, men and women,

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a>

went on with their meals as if the scene was not an unusual one. Whether this
is due to a change of sentiment, or to policy induced by fear of the re-adjusters,
may be open to doubt, but the fact is significant. No less so is the fact that not
a single colored man had a seat in the Convention at Cincinnati. If the unusual
treatment of the negro voter in Virginia is due to a change of sentiment, this
change is not so observably great in the Union at large. If due to fear, this fear
is not so great in other States as in this where the colored line has been broken.
This would seem to indicate that a solid front will be maintained longer on
national than on State issues. We have discharged our duty in regard to these
facts when we have simply stated them. Their cause and significance we leave to
others; while we take the opportunity for saying, that not until the negro voter, by
his intelligence and virtue, commands the respect of his fellow-citizens, can he be
other than an object of contempt and abuse when weak, and of fear when strong;
and a source of danger, whether weak or strong.</p>

<h3>HARD CASES.</h3>

<p class="p1">“The destruction of the poor is their poverty.” This is illustrated not alone
in the history of families, but of missionary enterprises. Poverty, long continued
and excessive, breeds a thousand evils more destructive and more difficult to
overcome than poverty itself. The very features of a given case which constitute
its strongest appeal for help, are the ones which render it almost impossible
to afford relief, however much help is given. This, the experience of all philanthropists,
is many times repeated in the history of our work, and the wisest
discrimination is necessary to ensure that our efforts shall be made where the
greatest good can be done; not necessarily where misery and ignorance utter
their loudest wail.</p>

<p>One of our missionaries writes from a field where the people are living very
near the line of absolute starvation. They are as ignorant as could be inferred by
the most logical mind from their whole past history; they are as bigoted and superstitious
as their training can legitimately make them; they are as much in need of
what the missionary offers them as a people can be. If he partially educates the
children, the Stygian darkness of their homes seems to blot out what they have
learned; if he enrolls them in the temperance army, they lose step when they
pass the boundary of childhood; if a hopeful revival comes to cheer his heart,
causing him to forget his past toils and despair, the converts over whom he
rejoiced are swallowed up by the old churches about him, which teach salvation
through loud shouting or semi-occasional feet-washing; and his hopes would die,
only that there are a few bright ones among the children who have twined themselves
about his heart.</p>

<p>Amid the almost universal chorus of rejoicing from all parts of the field over
abundant and cheering results, there comes, once in a while, a note like this from
one who labors, not less abundantly or acceptably than others, but with more
doubtful success.</p>

<p>From another field, the missionary tells of a revival commencing among his
own people, which was the signal for desperate <em>rival</em> as well as revival efforts in
the other colored churches, directed largely to the end of drawing away from him
the results of his labors. He notes a fact which seems to him strange, but one
which, we apprehend, is destined to repeat itself with great frequency as the work
of education goes on. The colored people seemed less responsive to the efforts

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a>

which the church, unusually active, puts forth. As the negro becomes more
intelligent, we hope and believe that he will prove less highly inflammable; and
he should comfort himself with the assurance that the results of all genuine
religious revivals belong to the Lord, and we will rejoice in it all, under whatever
banner the new recruit marches. The bigotry of sectarianism, which is of ofttimes so
trying, should be classed with other sins which the Gospel, rightly preached and
broadly illustrated, will in time remove; and, if under educational influence, the
negro kindles more slowly to religious zeal, he will doubtless burn more steadily,
and in the end yield more light and heat.</p>


<hr class="chap" />

<h3>TEACHER OR MISSIONARY, WHICH?</h3>

<p class="p1">The <cite>Natal Mercury</cite>, South Africa, paints a dark picture of the Caffres, even of
those who have professed Christianity. Many fathers, it says, still sell their
daughters in marriage for cattle as in years past, and many practice polygamy,
which still has a very strong hold upon those of whom better things ought to be
expected.</p>

<p>This is, indeed, cause for deep regret, but ought not to be of great surprise.
It may be true, that by one supreme exercise of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ,
the results of a whole life of debauchery can be corrected in a single moment;
that impure imaginations and dominant appetites and perverted tastes may all be
utterly eradicated, and the degraded slave of many years restored to the normal
condition of an uncorrupted child. This may be, for men assert that it has
been done; but, most assuredly, it is not so common as to be expected ordinarily.</p>

<p>The prodigal who has gone into a far country has a long journey to retrace,
and he comes back with many swinish tastes and habits of thought which he
masters, if at all, by most persistent, prayerful and painful efforts.</p>

<p>The grace of Christ comes in as most stimulating and efficient aid in these
efforts; but it comes as aid to effect, and not in the form of accomplished result.
What the exact, literal truth may be in the poet-prophet’s prediction, that “a
nation shall be born in a day,” we do not know; what new forces may be called
into play, or what added efficiency may be given to those now employed, when the
kingdom advances with millennial power and celerity, we know not; but as yet,
no labor-saving machinery is known to the Church militant. The Gospel has still
to be carried by laborious, self-denying effort into the homes of the degraded,
and it gains its victories, if surely yet slowly, over the vices and evils of man’s
corrupted heart and life, and he comes to the stature of a perfect man in Christ
Jesus by a gradual growth.</p>

<p>The Sandwich Islands afford the striking illustration of the
prophecy to which allusion has been made. But, in this case, the “day”
covers more than half a century, and has not yet reached its meridian,
and even there deplorable facts prove that the mass of the people might
be “born again and again,” as the good colored preacher has it, with
advantage. We are told that in the homes of the people are yet to be
found many of the fruits of their long degradation—much impurity of life,
little of the spiritual strength and elevation of character which the
Gospel produces as its ripened fruit.</p>

<p>The question comes, and often with a pressure from our friends, as to the
multiplication of missionaries, and, of course, because of our limited means,
corresponding diminution of educational work. Our work is limited by the
money put into our hands, and, therefore, we are compelled to choose between

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a>

them, when we cannot do both of two desirable things. It would be
pleasant, and a source of great spiritual comfort and social advantage
every way, if we could send an excellent Christian woman into every
negro cabin of the South, who should bring her refined womanhood into
loving and sympathetic contact with the ignorant and lonely aunties,
who never see a cultured white woman socially. It were easily possible
to organize an evangelistic movement which would set the religious
nature of the negro ablaze, and gather the people by tens of thousands
into the churches which could be erected with the money now employed to
sustain our schools; but all this would leave the negro helpless, at
the mercy of the bulldozer or debaucher, and still under the control of
his licentious and dishonest habits.</p>

<p>The work must be more thorough, and, therefore, more tedious than this. The
negro <em>character</em> needs to be created in germ, and then developed into a worthy
manhood and womanhood by thorough Christian culture, and the best and only
adequate missionaries are the Christian teachers in our schools.</p>

<p>Conversion, as the negro in his ignorance understands it, is not the most
important or desirable thing to be accomplished. We must first secure an enlightenment
of the understanding, a toning up of the moral constitution, which
shall give value to conversion when it does occur. Conversion is but the beginning
of a new life—a beginning which is utterly worthless except in connection
with an adequate conception of what that life is, and unless that life follows.
No one who at all comprehends the nature of the work to be done, will advocate
other policy than the one we now pursue of “hastening slowly.” We must
enlarge, equip and multiply our educational facilities through the South. When
this has been done, the number of missionaries may be multiplied manifold with
advantage; but to displace or weaken educational agencies for those that aim at
conversion and spiritual comfort, would prove utterly disastrous.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>WRONGS OF THE PONCAS.</h3>

<p class="p1">The removal of the Poncas from their reservation, and the failure of Congress
to pass the bill for their relief, illustrate the facility with which crimes, and
blunders which have all the fateful results of crime, have been committed by us
against the Indians; also, the criminal tardiness with which we correct such
blunders.</p>

<p>The Government in 1868 made a new treaty with the Sioux, and settled them
upon reservations in Dakota, which included 96,000 acres of land belonging to
the Poncas, one of the most peaceable of all the Indian tribes, who had held and
had been dwelling upon this land ever since they were known as a tribe—held it,
too, as an absolute grant from the United States, under a guaranty of peaceable
possession during good behavior. Without their knowledge or consent, as also
without a shadow of complaint against them as a tribe, their reservation was set
apart and given into possession of the Sioux. Failing to gain their consent to a
removal, the Government forced them, without compensation, for their homes and
fields, or other losses, to abandon their own and settle upon a reservation in the
Indian Territory, where the climate was to them inhospitable. As a result of
this, their numbers have been greatly diminished, they have become discouraged
and disheartened, and are making no progress toward self-support. This alienation
of their lands was an acknowledged blunder, due to ignorance of boundaries
on the part of Congress; but their arbitrary and cruel ejectment from their homes,

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a>

without charge of crime, and in violation of most solemn pledges, is more than a
blunder; it is an act of high-handed injustice and robbery.</p>

<p>The bill reported by Senator Dawes, of the Senate Select Committee, to investigate
their removal, requires the Secretary of the Interior to return the
Poncas without delay to their Dakota reservation, and provides that their
title to the same shall be deemed valid, anything in the Sioux treaty to the contrary
notwithstanding. It also requires the Secretary of the Interior to restore to
the Poncas “use and enjoyment in the same condition, as nearly as may be, when
left by them, all houses and other improvements and personal property belonging
to the tribe when removed from Dakota, and for all the foregoing purposes provides
an appropriation of $50,000.” The minority report proposed simply to compensate
them for losses sustained by removal, but hints at no remedy for the
wrongs they have suffered in this removal.</p>

<p>And now Congress has adjourned without action of any kind for their relief,
and they are left to brood over their wrongs, and mature such plans of revenge as
suggest themselves to savage minds.</p>

<p>The appointment of a commission to China to investigate, report upon, and
adjust the difficulties growing out of Chinese immigration, suggests the propriety
of a commission of like character, as regards its members, to take into consideration
the agitating questions relating to the Indians. There is nothing which
more nearly touches our honor, or more intimately affects our peace and prosperity,
than does the condition of these people. We believe that a commission of statesmen
would devise some solution of our difficulties, and suggest a remedy for the
wrongs and injustice which have characterized our treatment of them, and thus
bring to an end their wild and lawless mode of life.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>THE NEGRO ON THE INDIAN.</h3>

<p class="p1">The negro teacher of the Indian boys at Hampton pithily says some things
which go right to the heart of his subject, and are well worth repeating and
remembering. The following extracts are from Prof. Robbins’ Report to the
Trustees of Hampton Institute. The much-abused negro, forgetful of his own
wrongs, stands before the Anglo-American to plead for the Indian and urge a
more excellent treatment of him. We commend the whole report to the thoughtful
consideration of those who yet doubt the capacity of either the negro or
Indian for Christian civilization:</p>

<p>“The Indian problem which the people of the United States have so long been
trying to solve may be briefly stated thus: Shall we be able to teach the Indians
to surrender their lands and their houses to us, when we want them, without fighting?
It is a singular fact that the American people require more Christian charity
from the Indians than they themselves are ready to give.”</p>

<p>“The question is not, can the Indian learn, but will he put his knowledge to
practical use? The answer to this question depends upon the future policy of the
Government. The white man, to put his knowledge to the most practical and
profitable use, has a choice of location. He goes where his services are most demanded,
and where he can get the best returns for his labor. Are these Indians
to be bound to get their living on one reservation, or will they be left free to
choose homes for themselves?”</p>

<p>“Unless education is made to mean more than brain culture, it may yet prove
the curse of the Anglo-Saxon race. Thousands of young men and women who

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a>

leave our high schools, seminaries and colleges, all over the land, graduate a degree
higher than their social surroundings. The majority of them return to their homes
unprepared to put their philosophy and literature into every-day practical life.
With them, life becomes one continued grind, and the long list of intelligent
criminals is only a sad sequel of it. The education which will nerve and strengthen
a man for his calling in life is the most practical, and is the most needed
to-day.”</p>

<p>“The condition of the Indian is unlike that of any other people in the world at
present. He is not only banished from the best contact with civilization, but he is
hated, hunted, envied, and yearly the boundaries of his place of exile are growing
smaller; his rights are conferred by a superior power, and are so limited that his
gun is his only defence, for the awful judgment of the nation is always against
him.”</p>

<p>“It should not be asked, how can we avoid war, but how can we introduce the
arts of peace and throw the Indians on their own resources? Every man should
be made to supply his own wants. The Indian question can only be solved by
meeting and conquering its difficulties.”</p>

<p>“We want to make savages Christians in a day, and after a short trial we see
that it cannot be done. Christianizing is not the work of a day or a year, or a
spasmodic effort in any direction; it is a continued and constant effort.”</p>

<p>“The Indians should be allowed to assimilate with, and become a part of, our
nation’s life. Are there always to be national prison pens for them; or will they
some day enjoy those ‘certain inalienable rights’? It is wonderful how slow the
Anglo-American has been to perceive that this Declaration refers to no particular
race or color, but speaks of ‘all men.’”</p>

<p>“It takes a higher degree of civilization than all Anglo-Saxons possess, to give
up an opinion to which one stands committed, even when he knows it is false.
But it is grand to think that neither fears nor prejudice can be a final obstacle to
the work. The greatest revolutions in popular opinion which the world has ever
known have been the outgrowth of a few strong hearts that have believed in, and
have achieved, success.”</p>

<p>“We can afford to wait; the American public cannot be educated in a day
any more than the Indian. The people will be ready by and by to lay aside legends
two hundred years old, and accept facts as they are. The ideal Indian is dead;
the true Indian is living and progressing. It is time to concede that he is a man.
Take from him what you will in the scale of civilization, but do not subtract his
manhood; it is his by Divine right.”</p>

<p>“The answer to the Indian question must be broader than his reservation and
broader than his territory; it must be as broad and as long as these United States;
with all their rights and privileges.”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>EADLE KEAHTAH TOH.</h3>

<p class="p1">What this means we do not know, but lack of room alone prevents a reprint
in these pages of the entire contents of the second number of this charming little
paper, published at Carlisle Barracks, Pa., in the interest of the Indian Training
School, and to some extent by the Indians, since we are told that a Pawnee boy
set up about one-half of the type, and much of its contents was written by them.
There is a letter from White Thunder to his son in Capt. Pratt’s school, in answer
to some complaints he had made, telling him: “Your letter did not please me. I

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a>

am ashamed to hear from others in the school that you act bad, and do not try to
learn. I send you there to be like a white man, and I want you to do what your
teacher tells you. Remember the words I told you. I said if it takes five or ten
years, if you do not learn anything you should not come back here.”</p>


<h4>OUR PROGRESS.</h4>

<p class="p1">Under “Our Progress,” the declaration is made that, so far, results show
“that these boys and girls have come to a determination to throw aside the
Indian’s mode of thought and feeling with the old dress and way of life. This
seemed apparent in the beginning, but we feared that the older ones, at least, would
soon grow weary of the restraint, which they must find very irksome. We have
between sixty and seventy pupils over sixteen years of age. With few exceptions,
these young men and women are helpers in discipline, as they are in all the manual
labor necessary for their mutual comfort.</p>

<p>“Some time ago, one of the young men came to the girls’ quarters and asked to
see his sister. The interview was in the presence of an interpreter, who reported
that he gave the little girl a kind but very serious talk. He told her that he had
noticed that she was noisy and idle, and that she laughed too loud on the playground.
Said he, ‘We came here to learn. I do not know the white man’s way
very much yet, but if I do wrong it is because I do not know what my teachers
want me to do.’ Several instances of the same kind have occurred since, showing
that these boys consider themselves the guardians of their sisters. These are
Sioux boys just from their tribes. The interpreter tells us that among the Sioux,
the boys and girls of the same family seldom or never speak to each other; this
makes it the more remarkable. They are far from indifferent to each other’s comfort
and happiness, however, as is invariably shown in time of sickness or any
kind of trouble. The letters received by the children from their parents almost
invariably counsel obedience to teachers and submission to all the regulations of
the school.</p>

<p>“An intimate acquaintance with these children, and through them a better
knowledge of their people at home, have increased our respect and deepened our
sympathy for the Indians.</p>

<p>“We believe that the beginnings of a new life are stirring in many hearts.
What outward developments this life may assume, time will show. The good seed
is germinating. The air is full of promise. We can afford to wait.”</p>


<h4>OUR GIRLS.</h4>

<p class="p1">Again, how like “our girls” these promise to be under Christian culture:</p>

<p>“It is gratifying to watch the interest manifested by the little girls in the new
arrivals. They are so anxious for them to be washed and dressed anew, and want
to loan their own clothing until new can be made.</p>

<p>“Ruth, Grace and Rebecca seemed to feel themselves especially called
upon to watch over and teach the ways of the family to the little Nez
Perces girls, ‘strangers in a strange land’. They went with them to
put them to bed, and then got up early in the morning, to show them
how to dress themselves and put their room in order. For several days
these little girls watched over them, even leading them by the hand to
their meals, when the bell rang to call them together. They could not
understand one word of each other’s language, but they chattered away
like little birds; and yet six months ago, these same children were
quite as wild and uncivilized as the little Nez Perces, Harriet and
Sophia.”</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></p>


<h4>TSAIT-KOPETA.</h4>

<p class="p1">Hear what Tsait-Kopeta has to say of his old life and new, showing that
Indian nature, both old and new, is human nature:</p>

<p>“My life was pretty rough and sharp before I came this way, just like the
waves of the ocean, unsteady and not sure. I always was stumbling, but again
I would get up. I was a very smart servant for Satan. I was like an ox with his
yoke on me; but I worked for him willingly, just same he was my father. But what
kind of pay did he give me? Nothing, only shame and danger, and I think when
I suffered he laughed at me. I hope now I am free from him, and I think he is
sorry he lost me, but he can’t help; and now I have found the Great Master,
the Rock of Ages; and I saw His words, and He says, ‘Come unto me, all ye that
labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and
learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye shall find rest unto your
souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.’ And therefore I shall fall at
His feet and worship Him, and have confessed Him before men, and want to serve
Him only all life long.</p>

<p>“Now I can boast, Satan is my enemy. I return to him the shame he give me.
He used tell me, ‘You do what you want in earthly life, nothing hurt you; you only
got this life, by and by you die; so anything you want good or bad you do.’ Oh,
poor Tsait-Kopeta, how Satan kept me down and tempted. I don’t want something
to hurt or do bad and he ridicule me and lie. He said, ‘Ah, you coward!
only women feel that way.’ Satan made me prisoner; but Christ was sorry for
me and picked me out of his hand. He give me free, and told me go and no more
sin. I think very strange, Capt. Pratt, why I not know more then, why I did not
ask myself who make me and all the wonderful things. My life is very strange
and different from my past life. Little good at that time; often I hungry, thirsty
and cold, sorrowful, all the time I restless, and afraid of the enemies or trouble;
but this part of the Indian life I like sure, riding and hunting.”</p>


<h4>SUSETTE LA FLESCHE.</h4>

<p class="p1">Susette La Flesche (Bright Eyes), in the following extract from a letter to a
friend, illustrates what culture has done for an Indian girl, and discovers the
fountains of yearning and of hope in the heart of her people:</p>

<p>“I am coming more and more to the conclusion that the surest and almost
the only way of reaching the parent is through the children. Almost the only
comforts they have in their lives consist in their children. For them they are willing
to lay aside their arms and take up the plow and mower, all unused as they are
to labor. For them they are willing to pass over injuries, lest the wrath of the
Government be aroused and their children slain. For the sake of their children
they are willing to break up their nationality, their tribal relations, and all that
they hold dear, to become citizens. Said one man to me, ‘I wish I had had
the advantages in my youth which you have. I could then have had a chance
to become something other than I am, and could have helped my people. I am
now helpless and ignorant; but I shall die content if my children after me live
better than I have done.’”</p>


<h4>INDIAN MOTHER-LOVE.</h4>

<p class="p1">We are in danger of quoting the whole of this paper after all, but must
give the following extract from a letter from the wife of one who was stationed
at what is now Post Fort Sill. The incident occurred in 1869. We do not

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a>

envy him who can read this without shame, that during the 260 years of our
contact with these people we have done so little to call forth their finer qualities,
glimpses of which we catch in such a scene. We have done much to
degrade and brutalize them; almost nothing to save them:</p>

<p>“One bright spring morning I had just dressed my fair girl-baby in her
first short dress, then carefully placing her upon the bed, stood back, mother-like,
to admire. The outer door of my room was wide open, and I saw approaching
what seemed to me then the most miserable-looking squaw I had yet seen.
On she came with the grace and tread of an elephant; and oh, how revolting
she looked as she stood in the doorway! Her hair was cut short and hung
over her forehead to her eyes. Her face, neck and breast were painted in
narrow stripes of different colors. About her waist was fastened a short skirt
made of a part of a buffalo robe. She saw my darling, and before I knew what
she intended she had her in her arms. What did I do? Why, I sprang forward,
saying, ‘You horrid, dirty thing,’ and took my baby into my own arms. The
poor miserable woman looked at me in the most pitiful manner, and then gathering
up the corner of her blanket, she held it in her arms as one would hold a sick
infant, and at the same time with a mournful cry, she made a sign that her
baby had died; and to show how great her grief had been, she held up her hand
so that I could see she had cut off her little finger, which is one of the extreme
mourning customs of the Kiowas, and she also pointed to the deep scars on her
breast and arms. Tears ran down her cheeks, and my sympathies were so moved
that almost unconsciously I placed my baby back in her arms. How carefully she
handled her, and how tenderly she passed her hands over her plump limbs. After
some minutes she handed her back to me, and with a grateful look and smile,
giving me a hearty hand-shake, she departed. In a week she came again, and
placed in my lap about a peck of ripe wild plums, which ripen there in the early
spring. They had been freshly washed, and were brought to me in a piece of new
pink calico. Again she held the baby, and this time with signs asked permission,
and got it, to kiss our darling, for she was no longer disgusting to me. She left
me as before, and in another week she came again, this time bringing two buffalo
tongues. All she wanted in return was the pleasure of holding baby. This was
her last visit. Where she came from or where she went, I never knew. She
came and went alone.”</p>

<h3>BLACK MISSIONARIES FOR AFRICA—THE BISHOP CROWTHER PLAN.</h3>

<p class="center secauth">REV. G. D. PIKE, D.D.</p>

<p class="p1">If God “hath set bounds to the habitations” of the different races of men, or
to any race, that fact should enter into our plan of missionary work. It is our
duty to succeed. How to do it, is worthy of our greatest thought and most
earnest prayer. When we take the road to success in God’s work, we find heavenly
attendants all along the way, and abundant supplies of grace and every needful
thing. Just now the great question before the Christian world is, “How to succeed
with missionary work among the recently discovered Pagans in Equatorial
Africa.” Attempts have been made on the borders of this country for hundreds of
years, but no permanent success has been achieved inland. We have learned,
however, two things. One is, that white men and mulattoes are, as a rule, incapable
of preserving their health and lives in the climate of tropical Africa; and the
other, that the genuine negro has a constitution entirely fitted for its vicissitudes.
“Negroes for Negroland” must be emblazoned on the banner of the successful
missionary army, as it goes forth to battle against sin through the Dark Continent.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></p>

<p>The history of every missionary endeavor of long continuance among the
negroes in tropical Africa warrants this conclusion. But have negroes succeeded
as missionaries? They have not had much opportunity for doing so, as but few
missions have been committed to their care. Public sentiment has been against
them. The theory of manning stations by black men is comparatively recent.
Our great societies, however, are forced by the unfolding of providential events
to weigh the evidence in favor of the theory. The only question left to be
settled pertains to the negro’s aptitude and capacity. Can he achieve success
in the domain of missions? We are fortunate in having an illustration which
enables us to answer this question in the affirmative.</p>

<p>In 1821, an African lad was captured in a village about 100 miles from the
Bight of Benin, and put on board a slave-ship, from which he was subsequently
rescued by the English government and landed at Freetown. Here he was
received into a mission school under the care of Mr. Weeks. In 1825, when 15
years of age, he was baptized, and sent to England to study. Soon after, a Bible-school
for training native students to preach was established at Sierre Leone, and
the young African, who had been named Samuel Crowther, was recalled and
placed in this school, where he remained as student and teacher until 1841. At
this time, Lord John Russell’s famous Niger Expedition selected Mr. Crowther
as interpreter, and while exploring the territory on the west bank of the Niger,
he became exceedingly interested in the people living in the villages of the
country. When the purpose of that expedition was abandoned, Mr. Crowther
gave himself to missionary work in the towns he had visited. To fit him more
thoroughly for this, he was sent to England, where he remained till 1843. He
then returned to his chosen field, reduced the language of the people to writing,
and preached the Gospel to them in their native tongue. At one of his preaching
stations, he discovered his mother, brother and two sisters, who had been held in
slavery for many years, and procured their ransom. Among his first converts in
the great town of Abeokuta, was his own mother. At this place, he commenced
preaching in 1845. In 1861, there were reported to be 1,500 converts as the result
of his labors. In 1864 he was consecrated “African Bishop of the Niger.” Since
then he has proceeded with his great work with many additional facilities.</p>

<p>Some friends in England have secured for him a steamboat, valued at more than
$22,000, by which he is able to visit his mission stations, now nine in number,
located along the river, and superintend some 22 native preachers and helpers
under his charge. At an early age he married Asano, a girl delivered from bondage
at the same time with himself, and instructed in the same school. Several
children were born to them, and some of these, at least, are very worthy and helpful
to their father.</p>

<p>Here we have in a nut-shell an illustration of how the work may be done. Representatives
of the inland tribes may be gathered into suitable schools, taught
the things which pertain to the Christian faith, and practiced in the arts of
teaching and preaching, under the supervision of wise and experienced missionaries,
and then returned to their tribes to declare the good news of a salvation
which, through the blessing of God, they have experienced. The illustration we
have chosen would indicate that it were wise to establish the training-school in
Africa itself; and the fate of scores of white missionaries and others of our race,
who have perished on account of the climate of Africa, points to the wisdom of
selecting black men as teachers in these training-schools, whenever suitable persons
for the position can be found among the colored people.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></p>

<p>The venerable Dr. Moffat affirms that black missionaries for Africa is the
“Divine plan.” Dr. Blyden tells us that the climate of Africa recognizes only
pure negroes with favor. It conforms to no prejudices or customs of society in
assigning mulattoes to the negro race. Unmixed black men alone are welcomed
with long life and happiness.</p>

<p>God sets bounds to habitations, but the love of Christ in God is unbounded.
The good tidings of great joy has no metes. The heathen and the uttermost parts
of the earth are within the borders of the kingdom. The elect and precious are
separated by no climate or partition walls. They shall come up from the North,
South, East and West. We can only hope to succeed in doing our part towards
hastening the consummation when we have fallen into line with the logic of events,
and have accepted the new phases of work for the negro as they are providentially
unfolded.</p>

<h3>ITEMS FROM THE FIELD.</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Savannah, Ga.</span>—The pastor of the church at this place writes: “The standard
of piety among the colored people about us is so low that it is difficult to
create a moral conscience in our own people, and this fact shows the great need
there is for our churches.” There has been an unusual work of grace among his
people, and the “meetings have been quiet and orderly, as with a New England
congregation.” A number have been brought into the church whose experience
has been most satisfactory; none of them have had dreams or visions, but all tell
of simple faith in the Saviour, and express the purpose of a new life of intelligent
obedience to Him. “We are beginning to rise above the superstitious notions
which once prevailed.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Atlanta, Ga.</span>—June 20th, Rev. M. E. Strieby, D.D., preached the dedication
sermon of the First Congregational Church. The dedicatory service had
been delayed until all debt should be cleared off the house—a beautiful structure
in brick, with slate roof and tower, having cost more than $5,000. This done,
and a $300 Troy bell secured, all was ready. In the afternoon, a thanksgiving
service was held, consisting of music, the responsive reading of appropriate
Psalms, and addresses by the pastor, Pres. Ware, Prof. Francis, Supt. Roy, and
Mayor Calhoun. The latter, referring to the early days of trial, said that he had
always been glad that this people had friends, wherever they came from, who
were willing and able to help them.</p>

<p>—Rev. T. E. Hillson, of New Orleans, has been located at Flatonia and
Luling in Texas, to have charge of the two churches in those places, which are
far out upon the “sunset” route to San Antonio. Miss M. E. Green is in charge
of the school in Flatonia.</p>

<p>—Rev. Mr. Roberts, a recent graduate of the Talladega Theological Department,
has been appointed to take the pastoral charge of the church at Paris, Texas.
Mr. White, another student of Talladega, will probably take the school at Paris.</p>

<p>—Rev. L. C. Anderson, of Fisk, is teaching and preaching near Austin, Texas.</p>

<p>—Rev. B. A. Jones, a recent student in the Theological Department at Oberlin,
will take the pastorate of our church at Memphis, Tenn., in September.
Mr. Williams, whose health is not equal to the permanent charge, will continue
as a supply until that time.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></p>

<p>—Rev. G. W. Moore, of the Fisk University, is supplying at Florence, Ala.,
for the vacation; while Rev. S. N. Brown, another student, supplies the Howard
Chapel in Nashville.</p>

<p>—Rev. J. W. Strong, of Talladega, takes the place of Pastor O. W. Crawford at
Mobile during the vacation.</p>

<p>—Mr. Geo. Clark, of the Divinity School in Howard University, is supplying
Pastor Lathrop’s pulpit at Macon, Ga.</p>

<p>—Rev. J. W. McLean, of Ogeechee, is filling Rev. R. F. Markham’s place in
Savannah, Ga., during vacation.</p>

<h3>AFRICAN NOTES.</h3>

<p class="p1">—Col. C. E. Gordon, who was for a time Governor-General of Soudan for the
Khedive of Egypt, made strenuous and successful efforts to suppress the slave-trade
in those parts of Equatorial Africa which came within its influence. He
was forced, as our readers know, to resign his position, and in a pamphlet, published
by the British Anti-Slavery Society, states that the Khedive has permitted
the resuscitation of the slave-trade in Central Africa, and “every order he gave
for the suppression of this abomination has been cancelled.” He thinks that a
decided message from the French and English governments to the Egyptian ruler
would have great effect, but that the slave-trade will never be put down voluntarily
by the Khedive.</p>

<p>This slave-trade is one of those evils which time alone will not cure. Nothing
but bringing all the influences of Christian missions and Christian governments
to combine for its destruction, will overthrow it. We are glad that the British
and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society continues its holy war against it.</p>

<p>—The Church of Scotland Mission at Blantyre, on the Shiré River, Africa, has
opened another station. The new station is at Zomba, on the west side of the
Shiré River. It is a very elevated and secure spot, where thieves could be barred
out. The station is on the borders of Chemlumbe and Malemia, whose respective
chiefs are hostile to each other. The design is to reach both tribes. The neighborhood
is quite a populous one, and 4,000 people have asked the missionaries to
become their protectors. The Arabs carry on their nefarious trade between Blantyre
and Zomba, and frequently kidnap people from the latter place to fill out
their gangs. Refugees are almost constantly coming in at Blantyre, but none are
received at Zomba. A school has been opened at Zomba, and it has forty scholars.
The people are very attentive to the preacher, and sit a long time unwearied.</p>

<p>—Encouraging news continues to come from Bishop Crowther’s mission on the
Niger. The station at Bonny, which was founded fourteen years ago, and which
for some years past has encountered opposition and severe persecution, now is become
a bethel. Archdeacon Crowther says the voice of prayer is heard in nearly
every house, night and morning. Several persons have been baptized and there
are over 200 candidates for the sacrament.</p>

<h3>ATLANTA UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p class="center"><b>Baccalaureate—Commencement—Visit of the<br />
State Board—Report of Local Paper.</b></p>

<p class="p1">On Sunday, June 20, the baccalaureate
of Atlanta University was preached by
Rev. M. E. Strieby, D.D., of New York.
His subject was the path of the just
and the way of the wicked, the forming
of character, good and bad.</p>

<p>The examinations lasted three days.</p>

<p>The Commencement exercises, June
24, came off the same hour with the
nomination of Gen. Hancock. Orations
were pronounced by six young men, and
essays read by ten young women, all of
whom showed a fine scholarship and a
good degree of the art of elocution.
The most gratifying feature in these productions
was a zeal to help their people
by precept and example in the way of
economy, thrift, and moral reform. The
degree of A. B. was conferred upon
three young men, and that of B. S., with
the certificate of graduation from the
higher normal course, was given to
twelve students, male and female. The
music, which was of a high order, was
by the students. One captivating
piece was, “I am in a strange land.”
The college address was delivered by
Rev. J. E. Roy, D.D., and the diplomas
presented by Rev. M. E. Strieby, D.D.</p>

<p>The State Board of Examiners, ten
in number, came over, fresh from the
inspection of the State University at
Athens, and gave four days of faithful
attendance upon the examinations
and Commencement of this Institution.
Their Report is to be made to the
Governor and the Legislature, but it
was understood that they were greatly
delighted with the thoroughness of the
scholarship evinced, and the general
<i>morale</i>.</p>

<p>The <cite>Constitution</cite>, which reported each
day, said: “The examinations were
heard by many visitors who showed
great interest in all the proceedings.
The various questions were, as a rule,
aptly answered, and each student gave
evidence of the progress achieved in this
excellent and yearly growing Institution.
The familiarity with Greek which was
shown by the class, which was called
upon to construe and parse selections
from Demosthenes, was quite astonishing.
Everybody who has grappled with the
Greek language knows how difficult it is
to render the “Oration” properly. Special
proficiency was shown in the several
other branches upon which the students,
both male and female, were subjected
to rigid questioning. Our citizens are
cordially invited to visit the Atlanta
University, and see for themselves the
great good which the management is
doing for the colored people in our
midst.”</p>

<h3>TALLADEGA COLLEGE.</h3>

<p class="large center"><b>Commencement Exercises—Standard of Instruction—Literary
Society—Needs.</b></p>

<p class="center secauth">REV. O. W. FAY, MONTGOMERY, ALA.</p>

<p class="p1">The friends and patrons of Talladega
College have great occasion for
encouragement and congratulation, in
view of the present condition and future
prospects of that Institution, as evinced
by the examinations and exercises connected
with its Tenth Annual Commencement.</p>

<p>Those exercises opened grandly on
Sunday, June 6th, at 10.30 <span class="medium">A. M.</span>,
with a baccalaureate sermon by President
De Forest from the text (1 Tim. i.
12), “And I thank Christ Jesus our
Lord, who hath enabled me, for that
he counted me faithful putting me into

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a>

the ministry,” which was a clear and inspiring
argument for entering upon the
work of the Gospel ministry especially
appropriate for the occasion, as it was
addressed particularly to the class of
eight young men who this year graduate
from the Theological Department.
At 4 o’clock <span class="medium">P. M.</span>, a Union Prayer
Meeting of the Sunday-school classes
was held in the College Chapel, after
which Prof. T. N. Chase, of Atlanta
University, gave an intensely interesting
detailed account of his recent experiences
while visiting the Mendi Mission
on the West Coast of Africa. The
evening was given to the missionary
sermon by the Rev. O. W. Fay, of
Montgomery, on “The Divine Economy
in the Gospel,” or the plan according to
which God has been working, and is
destined to work for the redemption of
mankind. Text, Isa. xiii. 4: “He shall
not fail nor be discouraged, till he
have set judgment in the earth: and
the isles shall wait for his law.”</p>

<p>On Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
occurred the regular examinations
which, for impartiality, thoroughness,
and general familiarity with the subjects
considered, reflected great credit upon
both teachers and pupils. To one not
familiar with the standard of instruction
and scholarship in the colleges of the
American Missionary Association, it
might seem a little surprising to find
examinations in moral science, geometry,
history, pastoral theology, and all
higher branches, conducted <em>topically</em> and
well sustained; but, when it is known
that Pres. De Forest and Profs. Andrews
and Ellis, with their able corps of lady
associates, represent Yale, Olivet, Oberlin
and Mt. Holyoke, he is prepared to
expect and find all that is standard and
best, both in theory and practice, at
Talladega. There was no evidence of
special “cramming” on the part of the
students, or of special favoritism on the
part of the instructors. On the other
hand, the evidence was abundant that
all had been doing good work, thorough,
honest and true. Ex-Gov. Parsons,
one of Alabama’s most distinguished
citizens and a trustee of the
College, honored the examination of the
graduating class with his presence, and
expressed intense gratification with what
he saw and heard. A few other white
citizens of Talladega were present at the
various exercises from time to time
through the week. It is to be regretted,
however, that so few were inclined,
even by their presence, to show their
appreciation of what the College is doing
for their community and the State.
While there was no great throng of colored
people in attendance, there was a
goodly number present throughout the
week, who, by their remarkable appreciation
of the exercises, showed that
the occasion was to them “a feast of
fat things.”</p>

<p>The public exhibition of the “Adelphic
Literary Society,” on Monday evening,
was an occasion of interest. The
exercises consisted of declamations, original
essays, and a discussion of the question,
“Should capital punishment be inflicted
for murder?” The essays were
good, the declamations and the discussion
were presented with spirit and
a good show of ability, while the music
was excellent, all showing careful preparation
and a laudable ambition to excel.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening, the Annual College
Address was given by Rev. J. E.
Roy, D.D., Field Agent of the A. M. A.,
on the “Incompleteness of individual
talent.” In his own inimitable style,
the doctor entertained his audience with
happy illustrations, amusing anecdotes
and solid thought, showing the mutual
interdependence of society, and how
God has really and practically given “to
every man his work.” In the afternoon
of Wednesday, came the prize-speaking.
The contestants for prizes in declaiming
and reading were eight young men and
one young woman. Two prizes were contended
for; the first was tuition at the

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a>

College for one year, and the second, tuition
for half a year. A good deal of
commendable ambition was aroused, and
the contest was so sharp that the Committee
found some difficulty in awarding
the honors, which were finally conferred
by giving the first prize to H. L. Bradford,
of the Normal Department, and the second
prize to Spencer Snell, of the Theological
Department. Miss Dorcas White
was also awarded a second prize for an
essay on education. At 8 <span class="medium">P. M.</span>, as a part
of the programme for the week, was held
the regular Wednesday evening prayer-meeting,
led by the pastor, Prof. G.
W. Andrews—full, fresh, spiritual and
refreshing in its character. The subject
of the hour was “Christian education.”</p>

<p>The graduating exercises of Thursday
were, indeed, a fitting culmination of all
that had preceded them. The orations of
the eight young men who graduated were
in happy accord with the expectations
raised by their examinations the day before.
They were all thoughtful and
manly efforts, well conceived and well
delivered. As an illustration of what <em>can</em>
be done as well as of what <em>is being</em> done
for the colored race, the proficiency and
promise of these young men is highly
encouraging. They all go forth with
enthusiasm for their work. They all
have fields for immediate labor. It is
quite confidently hoped that at least one
of this class will decide to go to the
Mendi Mission on the “Dark Continent.”
But when we look about us
and see the almost innumerable fields
already white for the harvest, the inquiry
involuntarily comes. What are
these few “among so many”?</p>

<p>In accordance with her new motto,
Talladega College is doing a grand
work “Pro Christo et Humanitate.” Her
facilities and prospects were never
good as at present. She was never so
well deserving of support and patronage
as now. Her location among the mountains
of Alabama is delightful. The
long blue ranges of mountains, as seen
in the distance from the College campus,
along with the bracing mountain air,
strongly remind one of New England.
The only institution of its grade for
colored people in the State, its constituency
is simply immense.</p>

<p>With a farm of nearly two hundred
acres, her facilities are rare indeed for
aiding young men to obtain an education,
who are disposed to help themselves.
She has an efficient corps of
instructors, enthusiastic in their work.
Particularly is she fortunate in her new
President, under whose wise administration
the College has assumed a new
character and taken a new position in
the State. No one could listen to the
earnest yet tender and eloquent words
of counsel addressed to the graduating
class by Pres. De Forest on presenting
the diplomas, without the feeling that
he is just the large-hearted, scholarly.
Christian gentleman who is needed in
the place which he occupies.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding all this, Talladega
has very pressing needs. Her accommodations
for young men are altogether
inadequate to the demand, and
such as she has are of a very indifferent
character. A donation of $15,000 from
the Stone Estate, however, gives cheering
prospects that during the coming
year this sore need will be met.</p>

<p>But $10,000 more is needed just as
much for furnishing the new dormitory,
improving the College grounds, and
making necessary repairs on “Swayne
Hall,” which, though originally costing
$30,000, and a very stately building, is
literally going to ruin from lack of
means to repair it.</p>

<p>These facts being known, may it not
reasonably be hoped that in the near
future, friends of humanity and of Christian
education may be found, who will
recognize this rare opportunity for investments,
and come to the rescue of
a worthy and suffering College? Who
will be the first?</p>

<p class="center secauth">BY SECRETARY STRIEBY.</p>

<p class="p1">The little village of Berea, Ky., presented
a busy scene on the 16th day of
June. Commencement day brought together
a crowd that for numbers and
variety is seldom collected on such an
occasion. The gathering began early in
the day. Fine buggies and carriages
came filled with people, and with them
were wheeled vehicles of almost every
variety of construction and in almost
every stage of decay. But the larger
part of the crowd came on horseback in
true Kentucky style, frequently two,
and in some cases three persons riding
on the same animal. The College campus
comprises many acres, covered quite
uniformly with a fine growth of large
trees. On the day before, I had noticed
little slats nailed on these trees, and
their use was explained to-day by the
horses hitched to them. There must have
been 800 or 900 horses on the campus.</p>

<p>The audience numbered probably 1,800
or 2,000 persons of both sexes, both colors,
and of every stage in social position.
I judged that two-thirds were of the
white race, representing the well-to-do
classes as also the poorer farmers from
the mountains. The dresses were not
uniform in style, nor always after the
most recent fashion plates. I noticed
many old-fashioned sun-bonnets on the
heads of the colored women. There was
a full supply of babies in the audience,
with the usual evidence of good lungs
and voices—the essentials for future public
speakers. I particularly noticed that
the white babies carried off on this day
the palm in this incipient oratory, yet
I drew no inference as to the future.
The assemblage gathered in the Tabernacle,
a roughly built structure somewhat
in the style of the tabernacles at
Martha’s Vineyard and other watering
places, though, of course, less expensive.</p>

<p>The public exercises of the forenoon
were very creditable to the pupils as
well as their teachers in the essays and
speeches. The range of topics was wider
than is usual in our institutions in the
South, and with less reference to the
peculiar position and struggles of the colored
race. This was easily explained by
the fact that about half the pupils are
white. The afternoon was occupied with
addresses by Rev. J. A. R. Rogers, Secretary
Strieby, Pres. Fairchild, of Oberlin,
and two colored ministers of the vicinity.
The previous evening was taken up with
a stirring address in the chapel by a
Kentucky gentleman of prominent position,
the son of a former slave-holder.
It was in hearty sympathy with the
work in Berea College, and concluded
with some very timely and practical advice
to the colored people, which they
heartily applauded.</p>

<p>Berea College is doing, as may be
seen, a peculiar work. No institution
in the nation approaches it in uniting
the two races in the same school.
As a pioneer in the breaking down of
caste prejudice, it has no rival; nor
is this purchased by lowering the one
race at the expense of the other, nor by
any approach to the blending of the
races in marriage. It is simply a quiet,
unpretentious and practical working out
of the brotherhood of man in educational
and religious co-operation.</p>

<p>The pioneers and principal workers in
founding and carrying forward this noble
Christian enterprise were present—John
G. Fee, J. A. R. Rogers, E. H. Fairchild,
and others. It is seldom that
men live to see with their own eyes so
great a revolution as that which Berea
witnessed in the contrast of this Commencement
day with the dark days of
persecution, banishment and danger.
Tales were told me at quiet tea-tables,
of times of trial and deliverance, that
moved the heart over scenes that occurred
not in old historic times, but on
spots within eye-glance, and participated
in by the narrators.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></p>

<p>Berea College is well equipped with
buildings and a good corps of teachers.
The Ladies’ Hall is modeled after, and
about the size of, the similar building
in Oberlin. Howard Hall gives excellent
facilities as a boys’ dormitory. The
new chapel is a model of neatness and
convenience. Other and smaller buildings
meet other wants, and while another
edifice could be well used, yet
Berea’s great need now is <em>endowment</em>;
and to those who have the means, and
are looking for a place to use it for the
nation’s welfare and the advancement
of the Redeemer’s kingdom, we can
safely and unhesitatingly turn their attention
to this worthy and growing institution.</p>

<h3>TOUGALOO UNIVERSITY.</h3>

<p class="large center"><b>African Macedonia—Usefulness and Needs—Work
of Grace—Waiting for Supplies.</b></p>

<p class="center secauth">REV. H. S. DE FOREST, TALLADEGA, ALA.</p>

<p class="p1">A run into Mississippi, and two days
spent at Tougaloo, have given me a fresh
sense of the importance of our work in
its entirety, and a special interest in
Tougaloo. This institution, in the centre
of the great cotton State, where the
black soil seems the natural home of the
black man, has a field as large, as needy
and as hopeful as can well be desired.
From Marion, Ala., at the east, to far
beyond the Mississippi on the west,
north from New Orleans and south from
Holly Springs, each about two hundred
miles away, Tougaloo sits alone, and has
undisputed possession of a great, a populous,
and a waiting African Macedonia,
crying out, “Come over and help us.”
The University, with meagre equipments
and limited accommodations, is
trying to answer that cry. It is doing
much, very much; but how little compared
with what might be done and
ought to be done!</p>

<p>Tougaloo is seven miles from Jackson,
the State capital, on the railway
from New Orleans northward, having a
location of wonderful beauty, and advantages
peculiar to itself. The farm
of five hundred acres is now under
good cultivation. The facilities for
marketing produce are good, and under
judicious management it is believed
the work of students may do much
towards paying their expenses. The
mansion house, built with great taste
and care by a planter who was never to
occupy it, crowns a gentle slope; while
in front is a native grove, or forest, of
as weird-like and enchanting beauty as
can well be found on this rounded earth.
The oaks are of the giant order, almost
colossal in their proportions, while from
the great arms hang abundant tassels of
Spanish moss. Here, on June 3d, under
this witchery of shade, on improvised
seats, the exercises of Commencement
were held. Horses, mules, and vehicles
of all kinds, at an early hour, were
hitched under the trees. Visitors came
by the tens and the scores; but finally,
a special train put down its brakes at
the station, and hundreds, with lunch
baskets in hand, were swarming through
the woods, and massing themselves near
the platform. Seven young men, after
the ordeal of a searching examination, if
I may judge from the little I was in time
to hear, pronounced their orations and received
their diplomas. The addresses of
the graduates were thoughtful, full of
moral earnestness, well delivered and
well received by the great audience,
among whom were representatives of the
clergy at Jackson, the Board of Trustees,
and the Superintendent of Education.
Several of these visitors added words of
hearty and well-deserved commendation.
The impress of the instructors was manifest
throughout the exercises. This
thought pervaded all the speeches: <em>there
is work to be done, and we wish to have a
hand in it</em>. Back of the stage, as the
class motto, hung the old, but not outworn,
“Labor omnia vincit.” The motto
suggested the theme of the first speaker.
The address in the afternoon was on
“The field and the victories of work,”

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a>

and idleness had no mercy that day.
Apparently, there is not much of it about
the institution. Under the direction of
the Principal, Rev. G. S. Pope, a man of
long experience in this Southern field,
singularly fitted for his post and well
sustained by earnest co-laborers, both
in-door and out-door industries have been
greatly promoted. The farm and garden
are beginning to show what good
husbandry can do. Blooded cattle are
taking the place of the native lean kine;
improved groves are disclosing their
richness; while the garden not only supplies
the large family at the University,
but is affording some surplus for others.
Strawberries from nearly an acre of land
have been picked this year, and largely
sent to Chicago. This industry promises
well, and will be increased in the
future.</p>

<p>The needs of Tougaloo are as apparent
as its present usefulness. Besides the
mansion and the out-buildings, many of
which are old, there is a chapel with a
second story containing rooms for young
men, and also a boarding hall, with dormitories
for young women above. These
three principal buildings are of wood,
the mansion house occupying the centre.
These accommodations are far too
small. To meet a present necessity, a
rough barrack has been put up, giving
nine additional rooms. The attendance
during the past year has been about two
hundred, and nearly all have been boarders
in the family. Increase the accommodations
and the attendance might be
doubled at once; but what would a
school of four hundred be among the
tens of thousands in this great State
who are hungering for education? At
mid-winter a work of grace pervaded
the school, and not far from thirty, it
was thought, of these pupils became
Christ’s disciples, and they go forth
with new purposes. The influences for
good from Tougaloo are not easily computed;
its grand possibilities reach out
towards the infinite.</p>

<p>It seems strange to us who are on the
ground, glad to man these out-posts and
give what we have of life and vigor to the
work, that needed supplies are not forthcoming.
Give us adequate appliances,
and we can greatly multiply our usefulness.
We wish to be re-inforced, not
relieved. Our commissariat is insufficient.
We are glad to give ourselves to
this work, but we need supplies. And
we cannot think that life is cheaper than
lucre; that men at the rear can afford to
neglect those who are allowed to go to
the front; and if America has any front
in this nineteenth century, it is still
down South. We wish to advance all
our lines, and are simply waiting for
supplies.</p>

<h3>BREWER NORMAL SCHOOL.</h3>

<p class="center secauth">J. D. BACKENSTOSE, GREENWOOD, S. C.</p>

<p class="p1">The work of Brewer Normal Institute,
for the past scholastic year, closed very
successfully, and, as far as we know, to
the satisfaction of all its patrons, on
June 24th.</p>

<p>The two days’ examinations were unusually
thorough and very satisfactory.</p>

<p>The Annual Address was delivered on
the morning of the 24th, by Prof.
J. Wofford White, of the Yorkville
Academy at Yorkville, S. C., on “The
benefits of an education.”</p>

<p>The address was worthy the man and
the subject, and will doubtless be long
remembered by the very large audience.
On the rostrum beside the speaker were
clergymen of three different denominations.</p>

<p>At 3 <span class="medium">P. M.</span> the audience again assembled,
and was addressed by several
of our former students, who have been
engaged during the present year in
teaching.</p>

<p>The annual exhibition took place in
the evening, and long before the hour
of commencing arrived, our large hall,
(which was tastefully decorated with
wreaths and flags for the occasion,) was
crowded to its utmost capacity, so that

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a>

we could hardly make our way to the
rostrum.</p>

<p>By competent judges, the declamations
were pronounced superior to any
heard on former occasions of a similar
character, and not inferior to many exercises
presented in regular college
commencements.</p>

<p>The school has been larger this year
than ever before, and it has been difficult
for us to accommodate all who
have applied for admission.</p>

<p>We have had much for which to be
thankful during the past year connected
with this Institute; but let this be an
inspiration leading us to greater achievements
during the year to come.</p>

<h3>STORRS SCHOOL.</h3>

<p class="p1">The Storrs School at Atlanta, Ga.,
closed one of its most successful years,
on the 23d of June, with an examination
that gave great satisfaction to Sec.
Strieby, Prof. Chase and Supt. Roy,
who were present. A large number of
the parents and patrons were present
to rejoice in that evident progress of
their children. This school has had
for the year a total of 543 pupils; the
largest number at any one time, 356,
and an average of 333. The course of
study is that of the Grammar School.</p>

<p>It is recognized by the school authorities
of Atlanta as a school of the very
first quality. Miss Amy Williams, who
has been at the head of the Storrs for
more than a dozen years, and whose
qualifications as an instructor and a disciplinarian
are truly admirable, has had
associated with her this year Misses
Julia Goodwin, Amelia Ferris, M. E.
Stevenson, F. J. Norris, and Abbie
Clark.</p>

<h3>NORTH CAROLINA.</h3>

<p class="large center"><b>The Year’s Work at Woodbridge.</b></p>

<p class="center secauth">REV. WILLIAM H. ELLIS.</p>

<p class="p1">During the whole of last year, it
seemed impossible to make any deep religious
impression on the community.
Very few attended our services. The
children attended theirs and the grown
people theirs, and it often happened
that we could not get enough together
at either to make “a meeting.”</p>

<p>During the summer, generous friends
contributed a good supply of clothing,
which was bestowed only on temperate
persons. This caused a good deal of
complaint and some ill-will; but we insisted
that articles contributed by industrious,
temperate persons, many of
whom were in straitened circumstances,
should not be given to the intemperate
or unworthy. I am glad to report that
I found in all 160 persons, old and
young, whom I judged worthy. We
succeeded in making temperance respectable
in clean clothes. Our Band of
Hope had been organized five years, but
was not yet really a power. We now
clothed our members, overhauled our
books, expelled the unworthy, elected
new officers, and went ahead.</p>

<p>For a few weeks, we spent all our time
in trying those who had broken their
pledges. We also passed laws that
members might be brought to trial for
anything dishonorable to the Band, and
that all on trial must stand on the platform
during trial. So each Sabbath
every member is asked, “Have you
broken your pledge, and do you know
any one who has?” They were shown
the evil of having broken God’s holy
law, the guilt and danger of sin, their
own personal responsibility to God and
need of a Saviour, the dying love of
Christ, His willingness to forgive and
power to save, and they were especially
encouraged to trust Him for strength to
overcome every sin. The fact that they
were “sinners before the Lord exceedingly”
met them at every turn, but was
enforced so lovingly that a closer bond
drew all together as one. No gloomy
views of religion were inculcated,
but the Christian life was placed before
them as something to be longed for and
striven after. They were often called

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a>

aside by themselves, perhaps for
discipline, perhaps to be commended for
good behavior, and then personal faith
in Christ was explained to them, often
with prayer. We saw the signs of a
mighty work at hand in their endeavors
to leave off all sin, the evident desire to
know and do the right, and the almost
breathless attention when religious subjects
were spoken of. Some meetings
were held especially for those who desired
to become Christians.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Christian people were
appealed to over and over again. In
fact, our main teaching this year has been
“Bring forth fruits, meet for repentance.”
Sin has been rebuked, publicly
and privately, the Lord’s people have
been urged to deeper consecration, and
shown that if they brought their little
ones to the Lord in faith, He would
receive them.</p>

<p>On the first Sabbath in February we
had our Sixth Temperance Anniversary.
The children fairly astonished everybody
by their enthusiasm and ability.
The Band then made its reputation, and
the number has since been increased from
90 to 116, and we are glad to say, most
of the new members are grown people,
who have joined under full conviction
of the usefulness of our Band, and of
their own duty to it and themselves.</p>

<p>The drill and excitement attendant
upon the anniversary having passed
away, the minds of the scholars were
free to think again. They could not
study or play, and some would be often
in tears in school time. We were careful
not to encourage any sudden hopes
which might prove false. The work
was evidently of the Spirit, who was
sure to finish it. So we allowed time in
each case to settle the great question.
Fourteen in all believed during the
week. Some were forbidden to pray at
home. When they came to school they
might go out in the woods to pray, and
not get punished, so they went home
too happy to care for whippings.</p>

<p>In time the work reached the grown
people in the neighborhood, and nightly
meetings were held for weeks.</p>

<p>Our own people were quiet enough.
We had a little confusion from other
churches represented, but nothing serious.
The number, hopefully converted
on the first of March, was 31. Twelve
have been added since, and still there
are seekers. I am glad to say that every
one, so far as I know, still holds out well.</p>

<p>As the people think that to omit washing
feet at the communion would endanger
their title to heaven, we can form
no church. The Band of Hope is practically
our church, with one thing in its
favor—we have 100 more members than
we could have in a church. Almost
everybody around belongs to it, except
some of the old people, and they are
coming. Our members are bound by
voluntary covenant. Christ is the corner-stone,
and obedience to Him the
standard by which all are judged. We
warn, exhort, discipline and expel according
to Bible rules, and draw sanction
from it for all proceedings. There
are only seven unconverted members,
old enough to know themselves, and
they are under conviction. We lack
only the name and ordinances of a
church.</p>

<p>It is most pleasant to see the evident
affection shown by the young towards
the teacher, and our theological student,
Brother Scott, on whom a large share of
the work has fallen, and who, if he can
be assisted to an education, bids fair to
be a power in the land. The children
come early and stay late; they crowd
around us, and do all they can to please
us. They have the freedom of the house,
but we never miss even a button. Such
a school full of honest, truthful, obedient
and affectionate children is rare anywhere.
What shall be said of a set of
<em>very dark</em> colored children, in a community
where the ignorance is simply
appalling, and many of them go hungry?</p>

<h3>ALABAMA.</h3>

<p class="center secauth">REV. W. H. ASH, FLORENCE.</p>

<p class="p1">The work in Florence for the last two
years has been comparatively a new
one. The exodus of the colony from
here not only took from the town
some of the best citizens, but it robbed
our church of its strength, both in a
temporal and spiritual sense, leaving
behind the weakest spiritually and
the poorest financially. My first endeavor
was to impress upon the people
in their discouraged condition, the
necessity of having faith in God.</p>

<p>Since that time the church has grown
in religious life and character; members
have been added to it such, I
hope, as shall be saved.</p>

<p>We have had a revival which served
as a great quickening influence, though
there were not the number of conversions
we had hoped for. Within these
two years, we have built a beautiful
house of worship, which helps greatly
as an attraction to our service; as also
does our organ, sent by friends, being
the only organ in the colored churches.</p>

<p>The Sunday-school has grown in interest
and numbers, and has been able
to pay for its lesson papers this year.
The school has been built up almost entirely
out of new material. My wife
and self have taught a day-school in
connection with the church-work, which
has given strength to the church. Outside
of the primary and intermediate
classes, we have a class in United States
history, one in English composition,
and one in algebra. Up to this time
forty-six scholars have been enrolled.
Last year we began with three scholars,
closing with thirty-five. We have had
quite a number of applications for
boarding scholars, but had no accommodation
for such, with the exception of
one girl whom we felt almost bound to
take. Some of the others found places
with difficulty, because they wanted to
go to the Congregational school (so-called,
while the public is called the
Methodist school).</p>

<p>Strange to say, in this community the
country people are more able to sustain
a “pay-school” than are those in town.
But there is a reason for it: wages are
very low, and it really takes what is
needed for their absolute wants to pay
dollar a month, particularly if a family
numbers six or seven, which is really
the case in my parish. A woman’s
wages average from four to five dollars
a month. I sigh, and wonder how these
poor people ever will rise.</p>

<p>The Christian people who give so liberally,
and those who are intrusted with
the responsibility of this work, do not
know the difficulties and trying circumstances
under which Congregationalism
has grown, and is growing, in some parts
of the South. Past experience has taught
that tardiness in the appropriation of
ample facilities for the work in some
fields has caused the loss of rich results.
If those who have gone to Kansas had
seen the present condition of the church,
I believe it would have been a great
check upon their going, although there
were other reasons which helped to drive
them from the South aside from a lack
of proper facilities for the education
of their children.</p>

<p>Since the dedication of the church, I
have been anxious that our lot should
be inclosed, and on April 9th we gave
an entertainment whose results surpassed
our most sanguine expectations, as we
made $64 above expenses.</p>

<p>We have put up a neat fence in front,
well painted, which improves the looks
of the church, and have ordered lumber
for the other sides of the lot, and by
next week the whole will be fenced.</p>

<h3>MISSION WORK AMONG THE CHINESE MINERS.</h3>

<p class="center secauth">REV. W. C. POND, SAN FRANCISCO.</p>

<p class="p1">Can it be done? That is the question.
That it needs to be done, there can be no
question. There is scarcely a mining
camp in the State but has its Chinese
quarter, and there are many small camps
where the entire population is Chinese,
because Americans view the placers as
worked out. Close upon every advancing
wave of Caucasian emigration,
these follow into Nevada, Utah, Idaho,
Montana, and, just now, Arizona especially.
Thither all but two of those in
Santa Barbara, of whom we hoped that
they were born of God, have gone,
and one of the last two writes me that
he is soon going. On the other hand,
two of our best brethren in Oakland
have just migrated to Montana; one of
them, Lee Haim, who was our excellent
helper at Oroville till taken from our
work by a peremptory summons to
return to China. This doom has been
commuted, but only upon his undertaking
to remit amounts larger than
he could possibly save out of a helper’s
salary. The other of the two is Len
Soon, a man of fine presence, good judgment,
warm heart and earnest Christian
spirit, whose ever-ready volunteer aid
made him a pillar in our Oakland work.</p>

<p>These losses at the points already occupied,
suggest one way in which God,
taking the matter into his own hands,
is sending the Gospel to the Chinese in
the mines. They afford a partial solution
of the problem before us. A portion
of our scattered seed is made to
fall upon those moral wildernesses. We
follow these brethren with our prayers;
and I have ventured to pledge to them
our practical co-operation if they should
settle in any place where a hopeful missionary
work could be begun.</p>

<p>But a hopeful work of this sort, anywhere
in the mines, could scarcely be
conceived of but for faith. The difficulties
are unique, and are very great.
Our Home Missionary Society finds no
other service so fraught with discouragements,
as that in these regions. The
toil required is very hard, and the returns
are very scanty. Some churches
have been thrifty, and one or two are
thrifty still; but outside a less number
of points than you could count on the
fingers of one hand, they are either dead
or perpetually dying; preserved from
utter extinction only by persistent pastoral
service, sustained mainly by missionary
aid. But the difficulties encountered
in such work among our own
people, will be greatly enhanced in labor
among the Chinese. Miners are always
migratory, but the Chinese miners most
of all; and migration tends to barbarism,
among the Chinese most of all. Miners
depend upon luck. There is no possibility
of knowing what there is in a
piece of ground till you have worked it
through, and gotten it out. A single
day may show your season’s work to be
a success, or may doom it as a failure,
and what that day will disclose no
sagacity will enable you beforehand to

<a class="pagenum" name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a>

determine. Such occupations nurse the
gambling spirit, favor spendthrift habits,
and tend almost irresistibly to poverty.
And this is specially true of the
Chinese. In certain seasons of the year,
miners are apt to be waiting and idle;
in others, when the golden harvest must
be gathered, if at all, working to excess;
and in either case, the moral effect is
evil, not less so with Chinese than others.
American miners, with a few noble exceptions,
seem to know little about the
Christian Sabbath. It used to be, and
in some parts of California it still is, the
day for cleaning-up, for coming to the
central village for trading, for gambling,
for getting drunk; but even this distinction
in the more prominent mining
districts is passing away, and the wheels
of labor roll remorselessly over the
laborer’s best boon, the weekly day of
sacred rest. How much less can we
hope for the help of Sabbaths in reaching
with the Gospel the Chinese?</p>

<p>And yet, there they are, by the hundreds
and the thousands, precious souls,
bought with the blood of Jesus. Must
we let them die, without a single hand
stretched out, a single voice uplifted for
their rescue?</p>

<p>The mission at Oroville was our first
attempt to deal with this problem of
work among the Chinese miners. It
was begun, so far as downright and determined
effort was concerned, February 1st,
and continued till June 1st.
The school is closed during the hot
months, but will be resumed, I trust,
about October 1st. In some respects it
has fulfilled our hopes, and abundantly
repaid our somewhat large expenditures.
Six Chinese are reported as converted,
but we did not reach many of the
miners through the school, as such.
They would come to hear Lee Haim or
Lem Chung preach, thronging the little
mission house sometimes, and listening
to the Gospel, as, indeed, news, good
news possibly, with eyes fixed and ears
and even mouths wide open, to receive
the words. But coming and going, here
to-day to trade at the temple for luck
and at the stores for “grub,” to-morrow
gone we know not where, we could
learn but little of the work that good
news wrought within their hearts.</p>

<p>It is evident, however, that if we are
to reach our Chinese mining population
it must be mainly through evangelistic
service—a mission school at some central
point, as a headquarters, and a well-trained
helper to go forth from it, preaching
here and there on Sundays and on
week days, in the cabins or on the
streets, wherever he can induce his
countrymen to lend him a listening ear.
And in order to this, we ought to be
training helpers by the dozen where
now we are training one; not by sending
them to Academies or opening for
them a Theological Seminary, but by
putting them to work and letting them
learn to preach by preaching. This was
Wesley’s method for those half heathen
among whom his victories were gained
in England, and I am persuaded that it
is the beat method for these whole
heathen for whom our struggle is going
on to-day. Do not educate the helpers
up out of the range of easy sympathy
with those from whom they spring and
among whom they go, but let teaching
and working, lesson and practice, go
hand in hand. I am eager to do more
of this next year than we have ever done.
I am greatly encouraged respecting it,
by the results vouchsafed to us already;
but how to do it aright, with the resources
now at command, I do not, and
I fear, I cannot see, for the rules of
arithmetic are against it, and those
rules are stubborn things. You cannot,
in this case, reduce the multiplicand
(<i>i. e.</i> the helper’s salary, for it is at the
lowest point that justice will admit already),
and you cannot increase the
multiplier (the number of helpers) without
enlarging the product (<i>i. e.</i> the expense
to be met and the drafts to be
made). What shall we do about it?</p>

<span class="medium">INCORPORATED JANUARY 30, 1849.</span></h2>

<hr class="tiny" />

<p><span class="smcap">Art. I.</span> This Society shall be called
“<span class="smcap">The American Missionary Association</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. II.</span> The object of this Association
shall be to conduct Christian missionary and educational operations,
and diffuse a knowledge of the Holy Scriptures in our own and other
countries which are destitute of them, or which present open and urgent
fields of effort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. III.</span> Any person of evangelical
sentiments,<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A"></a><a
href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who professes faith in
the Lord Jesus Christ, who is not a slave-holder, or in the practice
of other immoralities, and who contributes to the funds, may become a
member of the Society; and by the payment of thirty dollars, a life
member; provided that children and others who have not professed
their faith may be constituted life members without the privilege of
voting.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IV.</span> This Society shall meet
annually, in the month of September, October or November, for the
election of officers and the transaction of other business, at such
time and place as shall be designated by the Executive Committee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. V.</span> The annual meeting shall be
constituted of the regular officers and members of the Society at the
time of such meeting, and of delegates from churches, local missionary
societies, and other co-operating bodies, each body being entitled to
one representative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VI.</span> The officers of the Society
shall be a President, Vice-Presidents, a Recording Secretary,
Corresponding Secretaries, Treasurer, two Auditors, and an Executive
Committee of not less than twelve, of which the Corresponding
Secretaries shall be advisory, and the Treasurer ex-officio,
members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VII.</span> To the Executive Committee
shall belong the collecting and disbursing of funds; the appointing,
counselling, sustaining and dismissing (for just and sufficient
reasons) missionaries and agents; the selection of missionary fields;
and, in general, the transaction of all such business as usually
appertains to the executive committees of missionary and other
benevolent societies; the Committee to exercise no ecclesiastical
jurisdiction over the missionaries; and its doings to be subject always
to the revision of the annual meeting, which shall, by a reference
mutually chosen, always entertain the complaints of any aggrieved agent
or missionary; and the decision of such reference shall be final.</p>

<p>The Executive Committee shall have authority to fill all vacancies
occurring among the officers between the regular annual meetings;
to apply, if they see fit, to any State Legislature for acts of
incorporation; to fix the compensation, where any is given, of all
officers, agents, missionaries, or others in the employment of the
Society; to make provision, if any, for disabled missionaries, and
for the widows and children of such as are deceased; and to call, in
all parts of the country, at their discretion, special and general
conventions of the friends of missions, with a view to the diffusion of
the missionary spirit, and the general and vigorous promotion of the
missionary work.</p>

<p>Five members of the Committee shall constitute a quorum for
transacting business.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. VIII.</span> This society, in collecting
funds, in appointing officers, agents and missionaries, and in
selecting fields of labor, and conducting the missionary work, will
endeavor particularly to discountenance slavery, by refusing to receive
the known fruits of unrequited labor, or to welcome to its employment
those who hold their fellow-beings as slaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. IX.</span> Missionary bodies, churches or
individuals agreeing to the principles of this Society, and wishing to
appoint and sustain missionaries of their own, shall be entitled to do
so through the agency of the Executive Committee, on terms mutually
agreed upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Art. X.</span> No amendment shall be made to
this Constitution without the concurrence of two-thirds of the members
present at a regular annual meeting; nor unless the proposed amendment
has been submitted to a previous meeting, or to the Executive Committee
in season to be published by them (as it shall be their duty to do, if
so submitted) in the regular official notifications of the meeting.</p>

By evangelical sentiments, we understand, among others, a belief
in the guilty and lost condition of all men without a Saviour; the
Supreme Deity, Incarnation and Atoning Sacrifice of Jesus Christ, the
only Saviour of the world; the necessity of regeneration by the Holy
Spirit, repentance, faith and holy obedience in order to salvation; the
immortality of the soul; and the retributions of the judgment in the
eternal punishment of the wicked, and salvation of the righteous.

<h2>The American Missionary Association.</h2>
</div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="article">

<h4>AIM AND WORK.</h4>

<p class="p1">To preach the Gospel to the poor. It originated in
a sympathy with the almost friendless slaves. Since Emancipation
it has devoted its main efforts to preparing the <span
class="smcap">Freedmen</span> for their duties as citizens and
Christians in America and as missionaries in Africa. As closely
related to this, it seeks to benefit the caste-persecuted <span
class="smcap">Chinese</span> in America, and to co-operate with
the Government in its humane and Christian policy towards the
<span class="smcap">Indians</span>. It has also a mission in <span
class="smcap">Africa</span>.</p>

<h4>STATISTICS.</h4>

<p class="p1"><span class="smcap">Churches</span>: <i>In the
South</i>—In Va.,1; N. C., 5; S. C., 2; Ga., 13; Ky., 7; Tenn., 4;
Ala., 14; La., 12; Miss., 1; Kansas, 2; Texas, 6. <i>Africa</i>, 2. <i>Among
the Indians</i>, 1. Total 70.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Institutions Founded, Fostered or Sustained
in the South.</span>—<i>Chartered</i>: Hampton, Va.; Berea, Ky.;
Talladega, Ala.; Atlanta, Ga.; Nashville, Tenn.; Tougaloo, Miss.; New
Orleans, La.; and Austin, Texas, 8. <i>Graded or Normal Schools</i>: at
Wilmington, Raleigh, N. C.; Charleston, Greenwood, S. C.; Savannah,
Macon, Atlanta, Ga.; Montgomery, Mobile, Athens, Selma, Ala.; Memphis,
Tenn., 12. <i>Other Schools</i>, 24. Total 44.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teachers, Missionaries and
Assistants.</span>—Among the Freedmen, 253; among the
Chinese, 21; among the Indians, 9; in Africa, 13. Total, 296. <span
class="smcap">Students</span>—In Theology, 86; Law, 28; in
College Course, 63; in other studies, 7,030. Total, 7,207. Scholars
taught by former pupils of our schools, estimated at 150,000. <span
class="smcap">Indians</span> under the care of the Association,
13,000.</p>

<h4>WANTS.</h4>

<p class="p1">1. A steady <span class="medium">INCREASE</span> of
regular income to keep pace with the growing work. This increase can
only be reached by <em>regular</em> and <em>larger</em> contributions from the
churches—the feeble as well as the strong.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">Additional Buildings</span> for our higher
educational institutions, to accommodate the increasing numbers of
students; <span class="smcap">Meeting Houses</span> for the new
churches we are organizing; <span class="smcap">More Ministers</span>,
cultured and pious, for these churches.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">Help for Young Men</span>, to be educated as
ministers here and missionaries to Africa—a pressing want.</p>

<p>Before sending boxes, always correspond with the nearest A. M. A.
office, as below:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<span class="smcap">New York</span>.... H. W. Hubbard, Esq., 56 Reade Street.<br />
<span class="smcap">Boston</span>.......... Rev. C. L. Woodworth, Room 21 Congregational House.<br />
<span class="smcap">Chicago</span>........ Rev. Jas. Powell, 112 West Washington Street.<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>MAGAZINE.</h4>

<p class="p1">This Magazine will be sent, gratuitously, if desired, to
the Missionaries of the Association; to Life Members; to all clergymen
who take up collections for the Association; to Superintendents of
Sabbath Schools; to College Libraries; to Theological Seminaries; to
Societies of Inquiry on Missions; and to every donor who does not
prefer to take it as a subscriber, and contributes in a year not less
than five dollars.</p>

<p>Those who wish to remember the <span class="smcap">American
Missionary Association</span> in their last Will and Testament, are
earnestly requested to use the following</p>

<h4>FORM OF A BEQUEST.</h4>

<p class="p1">“<span class="smcap">I bequeath</span> to my executor
(or executors) the sum of —— dollars in trust, to pay the
same in —— days after my decease to the person who, when
the same is payable, shall act as Treasurer of the ‘American Missionary
Association’ of New York City, to be applied, under the direction of
the Executive Committee of the Association, to its charitable uses and
purposes.”</p>

<p>The will should be attested by three witnesses [in some States three
are required—in other States only two], who should write against
their names, their places of residence [if in cities, their street and
number]. The following form of attestation will answer for every State
in the Union: “Signed, sealed, published and declared by the said [A.
B.] as his last Will and Testament, in presence of us, who, at the
request of the said A. B., and in his presence, and in the presence of
each other, have hereunto subscribed our names as witnesses.” In some
States it is required that the Will should be made at least two months
before the death of the testator.</p>

<p class="p1">We have been gratified with the constant tokens of the increasing appreciation of
the <span class="smcap">Missionary</span> during the past year, and purpose to spare no effort to make its pages
of still greater value to those interested in the work which it records.</p>

<p>Shall we not have a largely increased subscription list for 1880?</p>

<p>A little effort on the part of our friends, when making their own remittances, to
induce their neighbors to unite in forming Clubs, will easily double our list, and thus
widen the influence of our Magazine, and aid in the enlargement of our work.</p>

<p>Under the editorial supervision of Rev. <span class="smcap">C. C. PAINTER</span>, aided by the steady
contributions of our intelligent Missionaries and teachers in all parts of the field, and
with occasional communications from careful observers and thinkers elsewhere, the
<span class="smcap">American Missionary</span> furnishes a vivid and reliable picture of the work going forward
among the Indians, the Chinamen on the Pacific Coast, and the Freedmen as
citizens in the South and as Missionaries in Africa.</p>

<p>It will be the vehicle of important views on all matters affecting the races among
which it labors, and will give a monthly summary of current events relating to their
welfare and progress.</p>

<p>Patriots and Christians interested in the education and Christianizing of these
despised races are asked to read it, and assist in its circulation. Begin with the next
number and the new year. The price is only Fifty Cents per annum.</p>

<p>The Magazine will be sent gratuitously, if preferred, to the persons indicated on
<a href="#Page_254">page 254.</a></p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
